def bme(dm, allow_edge_estimation=True):
    r"""Perform balanced minimum evolution (BME) for phylogenetic reconstruction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dm : skbio.DistanceMatrix
        Input distance matrix containing distances between taxa.
    allow_edge_estimation : bool, optional
        Whether to perform an OLS-based estimation of branch
        lengths (``True``, default) or return a tree without
        branch lengths assigned (``False``).

    Returns
    -------
    TreeNode
        Reconstructed phylogenetic Tree with estimated edge
        values (if ``allow_edge_estimation`` is ``True``).

    Notes
    -----
    Balanced Minimum Evolution (BME) is a refinement of the distance-based minimum
    evolution problem where average distances between subtrees ignores the size of the
    subtrees. The BME algorithm implemented here uses the same OLS based edge
    estimation used with Greedy Minimum Evolution (GME).

    Examples
    --------
    Define a new distance matrix object describing the distances between five
    taxa: human, monkey, pig, rat, and chicken.

    >>> from skbio import DistanceMatrix
    >>> from skbio.tree import bme

    >>> dm = DistanceMatrix([[0, 0.02,  0.18,  0.34,  0.55],
    ...                      [0.02,  0, 0.19, 0.35,  0.55],
    ...                      [0.18, 0.19,  0,  0.34,  0.54],
    ...                      [0.34, 0.35,  0.34,  0,  0.62],
    ...                      [0.55,  0.55,  0.54,  0.62,  0]],
    ...                      ['human','monkey','pig','rat','chicken'])

    Perform Balanced Minimum Evoltuion (BME) and construct the minimum evolution tree
    representing the relationship between those taxa. This is returned as a TreeNode
    object.

    >>> tree = bme(dm)
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())

    Notice that, unlike neighbor joining, the tree is rooted at a taxa/leaf node.
    This will allow it to have nearest neighbor interchange performed on it without
    needing to re-root the tree.
